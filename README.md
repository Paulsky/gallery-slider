# Swiper for Woocommerce

Enhances the product image gallery in WooCommerce by integrating the Swiper library. This enables a responsive and touch-friendly slider for product thumbnails displayed on **product listing** (e.g., shop page, product categories pages, related products) rather than the single product gallery.
